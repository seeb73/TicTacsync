Tictac sync copy of ~proflutz/TicTacSync/sources GPS time sync more info https://tictacsync.org/ SAMD21 board
LIB's: RTCZero, MicroNMEA


I used a GPS GY-NEO6MV2 module without pps output on the goldpin. However, basically every GPS has such an output and you have to be careful and fit the appropriate cable yourself.
The SAMD21 board has been removed from the original repository but I use it so it will remain with me.
